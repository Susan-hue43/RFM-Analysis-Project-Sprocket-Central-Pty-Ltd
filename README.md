## Introduction

Customers are at the heart of every successful business. Understanding who they are, how they behave, and what they value enables companies to make informed decisions, build stronger relationships, and maximize the return on marketing efforts. Inspired by this principle, this bonus project builds upon the customer analysis previously conducted on Sprocket Central Pty Ltd during the KPMG Data Analytics Virtual Internship on [Forage](https://www.theforage.com).

Using historical customer demographics and transaction data, this project dives deeper into segmenting customers through **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** analysis. The goal is to identify key customer groups and recommend actionable strategies based on their value to the business.

## Key Findings

* **Champions** and **Loyal Customers** represent only **38.3% of the customer base** but contribute to over **54% of total revenue**.
* **Recent Customers** form the largest group (**25.5%**) but with relatively lower spend per customer.
* **At Risk** and **Lost Customers** have the lowest frequency and revenue contribution.
* The top 3 segments in **average frequency and spend** align with those having the highest monetary potential.

## Conclusion

The RFM analysis successfully segmented the customer base into actionable groups. High-value segments were identified, along with dormant customers who may require re-engagement efforts. The dashboard supports quick exploration and comparison of segment performance.

## Recommendations

* **Prioritize** campaigns for **Champions, Loyal Customers,** and **Potential Loyalists** to retain and grow revenue.
* Create **personalized offers** for **Recent Customers** to encourage repeat purchases.
